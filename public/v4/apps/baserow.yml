            **Baserow** is an Open-source no-code database and an Airtable alternative.
            This is an original one-click-app made by Gardens.
            Enter your Baserow configuration parameters and click on next. The app will be deployed for you.  It will take about 1-2 minutes for the process to finish.

            ❗**If you like this app**, consider [donating](https://github.com/sponsors/bram2w) or switching to a [SaaS version](https://baserow.io/pricing) to support developers.

            ✨✨ **Baserow is deployed successfully**. 
            Wait for a couple minutes for it to set up, then access at [http://$$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain](http://$$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain) and enjoy! 
            IMPORTANT: It will take up to 2 minutes for Baserow to be ready. Before that, you might see a 502 error page.
            **For Baserow to work as intended, you need to enable websocket support in Caprover settings after deployment.**
