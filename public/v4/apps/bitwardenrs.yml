            **Vaultwarden** is an unofficial lightweight implementation of Bitwarden featuring all the essential core functionality.
            This is a copy of the official Caprover image.
            Enter your Vaultwarden configuration parameters and click on next. The app will be deployed for you.  It will take about 1-2 minutes for the process to finish.

            ❗**If you like this app**, consider [donating](https://github.com/sponsors/dani-garcia) to support developers.

            ✨✨ **Vaultwarden is deployed successfully**. 
            Wait for a couple minutes for it to set up, then access at [https://$$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain](https://$$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain) and enjoy! 
            IMPORTANT: It will take up to 2 minutes for Vaultwarden to be ready. Before that, you might see a 502 error page.
            ** For Vaultwarden to work as intended, you need to enable https, force https, and enable websockets in Caprover app settings**.
            If you added the admin password on setup, go to https://$$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain/admin to finish configuration.
